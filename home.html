    Thinking of you always, my dear. You lift me up and hold me down, you make
    me smile when I'm feeling down. You bring me peace, you bring me gifts,
    you're the person I'm most happy to share my life with. I love you now until
    the end of time.
    You have no idea how much my heart races when I see you.
    I love when I catch you looking at me.
    You're weird…but I like it!
    If I could give you one thing in life, I'd give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes, only then would you realize how special you are to me.
    If you were a movie, I'd watch you over and over again.
    In a sea of people, my eyes always search for you.
    What on earth did I think about all the time before you?
    If loving you was a job, I'd be the most deserving, dedicated, and qualified candidate. In fact, I'd even be willing to work for free!
    Your smile is literally the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life.
    If someone asked me to describe you in just two words, I'd say "Simply Amazing."
    You do a million little things that bring joy to my life.
    I know fairy tales come true because I have you.
    There are only two times that I want to be with you: Now and Forever.
    My six-word love story: "I can't imagine life without you."
    Stop making me think about you! I'm busy.
    Cuddling with you would be perfect right now
    If nothing lasts forever, can I be your nothing?
    You make my heart melt!
    I couldn't ignore you even if I wanted to.
    You make me forget how to breathe.
    Nobody is perfect, but you're so close it's scary 
    All I need is you right here.
    I love you more than I did yesterday but not more than I will tomorrow
    The only time I stupidly smile at my phone is when I get text messages from you.
    I always wake up smiling. I think it's your fault.
    I can't explain the way you make me feel when I hear your voice or see your face, but I adore it.
    Just had to let you know…loving you is the best thing that happened to me
    Can I borrow a kiss? I promise to give it back
    I think you're cuter than any cat picture

    I couldn't ignore you even if I wanted to.
    You make me forget how to breathe.
    Nobody is perfect, but you're so close it's scary 
    All I need is you right here.
    I love you more than I did yesterday but not more than I will tomorrow
    The only time I stupidly smile at my phone is when I get text messages from you.
    I always wake up smiling. I think it's your fault.
    I can't explain the way you make me feel when I hear your voice or see your face, but I adore it.
    Just had to let you know…loving you is the best thing that happened to me
    Can I borrow a kiss? I promise to give it back
    I think you're cuter than any cat picture
    Thinking of you always, my dear. You lift me up and hold me down, you make
    me smile when I'm feeling down. You bring me peace, you bring me gifts,
    you're the person I'm most happy to share my life with. I love you now until
    the end of time.
    You have no idea how much my heart races when I see you.
    I love when I catch you looking at me.
    You're weird…but I like it!
    If I could give you one thing in life, I'd give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes, only then would you realize how special you are to me.
    If you were a movie, I'd watch you over and over again.
    In a sea of people, my eyes always search for you.
    What on earth did I think about all the time before you?
    If loving you was a job, I'd be the most deserving, dedicated, and qualified candidate. In fact, I'd even be willing to work for free!
    Your smile is literally the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life.
    If someone asked me to describe you in just two words, I'd say "Simply Amazing."
    You do a million little things that bring joy to my life.
    I know fairy tales come true because I have you.
    There are only two times that I want to be with you: Now and Forever.
    My six-word love story: "I can't imagine life without you."
    Stop making me think about you! I'm busy.
    Cuddling with you would be perfect right now
    If nothing lasts forever, can I be your nothing?
    You make my heart melt!
    I couldn't ignore you even if I wanted to.
    You make me forget how to breathe.
    Nobody is perfect, but you're so close it's scary
